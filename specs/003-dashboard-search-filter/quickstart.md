# Quickstart: Dashboard Search and Filtering

## How to use

1. **Access the Dashboard**: Navigate to `/dashboard` after logging in.
2. **Search by Keyword**: Use the search bar at the top of the entry list. Type any word that might appear in your "Brief Thought" or the "Diary Content".
3. **Filter by Persona**: Click on the persona chips (e.g., ✨ Gratitude, 📖 Reflective) to show only entries written in that style.
4. **Combine**: Try typing a word and selecting a persona simultaneously to find specific memories.
5. **Reset**: Click "Clear Filters" or the "All" persona chip to return to the full list.

## Development Verification

- **P1 Verification**: Verify that typing "Secret" only shows entries containing that word.
- **P2 Verification**: Verify that clicking "Optimistic" filters out all other personas.
- **Performance**: Ensure filtering feels "instant" (under 300ms) with at least 50 mock entries.
